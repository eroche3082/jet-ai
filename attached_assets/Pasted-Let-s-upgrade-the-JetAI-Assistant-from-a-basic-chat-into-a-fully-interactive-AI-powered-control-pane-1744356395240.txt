Let's upgrade the JetAI Assistant from a basic chat into a fully interactive AI-powered control panel, known as **ChatOS**. This system will provide travel planning, booking, rewards, dashboards, and immersive interaction‚Äîall from the chat itself.

Here‚Äôs the full spec for this phase:

---

### 1. üß† Conversational Flow Upgrade
- Convert current chat logic to **one question at a time**.
- Add logic for follow-up prompts using Gemini AI memory:
  - Store answers temporarily (destination, budget, duration, etc.)
  - Allow corrections mid-flow (‚ÄúChange destination to Greece‚Äù)
- Include **multiple selection inputs** (e.g. checkboxes for interests).
- Format responses in markdown with emoji, buttons, and embedded actions (e.g. "Search Flights").

---

### 2. **Audio & Multimodal Features**
- Add audio input and output capabilities:
  - User can **speak** to JetAI (Speech-to-Text)
  - JetAI can respond with voice (Text-to-Speech)
  - Display speaker icon + mute/unmute option
- Allow image capture and photo replies (integrate WebCam or upload flow)
- Future prep for **video calls or avatar view** (optional for later)

---

### 3. **Bookings & Smart Actions inside Chat**
- Allow the user to:
  - Book hotels, flights, cruises, excursions‚Äîall inside the chat
  - See real-time availability and pricing via API (mock or real)
  - Choose dates, passengers, payment options
- Enable **Stripe Checkout inside chat flow**
- Display confirmation with itinerary summary
- All actions tied to logged-in user profile

---

### 4. **Rewards & Loyalty Integration**
- Connect JetAI with external reward systems:
  - Airline miles (e.g. SkyMiles, AAdvantage)
  - Hotel points (e.g. Hilton Honors, Marriott Bonvoy)
  - Cruise loyalty programs (e.g. Crown & Anchor)
- Show reward status, points, redemption offers
- Allow points to be used as partial payment
- Implement **VidaRewards** as the internal points system

---

### 5. **Group Travel Features**
- Allow group planning inside the chat:
  - ‚ÄúPlan a trip with friends‚Äù
  - Invite others via link or email
  - AI will collect everyone's preferences and generate a group itinerary
- Group voting: restaurants, hotels, activities
- Smart split payment and budget management
- Live sync across users

---

### 6. **Dynamic Theming for JetAI Versions**
- Prepare the system to load different JetAI experiences:
  - `jetai.app/luxury`, `jetai.app/espanol`, `jetai.app/digitalnomads`
- Each experience has:
  - Different color scheme / fonts
  - Different assistant personality (tone, icon, welcome message)
  - Different feature availability (e.g. Luxury has concierge chat)
- Allow dynamic loading of `theme.json` or use `?theme=luxury` param
- Optional: DALL¬∑E logo generator per brand

---

### 7. **Dashboard Sync**
- Allow the assistant to access:
  - User dashboard (bookings, credits, preferences)
  - Past itineraries and chat memory
  - Membership status (basic/premium)
- Example: ‚ÄúCan you show me my next trip?‚Äù ‚Üí opens itinerary view inside chat
- Provide shortcut buttons like:
  - ‚ÄúMy Dashboard‚Äù  
  - ‚ÄúCheck My Points‚Äù  
  - ‚ÄúEdit My Preferences‚Äù  

---

Once these features are implemented, we can move to Phase 7:  
**Creator Mode + Avatar View + AI-Powered Travel Video Generator**.

Let me know when this implementation is complete.
