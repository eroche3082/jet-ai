⚙️ FASE 6: QUALITY CONTROL + RELEASE PIPELINE
- Full QC protocol:
    - Stress test (100 messages)
    - Intent misfire test (random user inputs)
    - Language edge cases (switch mid-convo)
    - Reconnect protocol on error
    - Model downgrade fallback (OpenAI if Gemini fails)
- Create automated testing suite for each agent
- System must notify Admin if agent is unresponsive

→ Must pass: QC logs + deployment approval from Super Admin

---

⚙️ FASE 7: BRANDING + DISCOVERY MODE
- Activate Discovery Mode:
    - Daily questions

**RULES OF ENGAGEMENT:**
- Do NOT proceed to next phase without explicit QA pass.
- You are monitored in real time by Super Admin.
- All bots must remain aligned with universal UI, model, SDK, and monetization rules.
- If any phase is incomplete, AI must flag it and generate checklist for Admin.

Begin now in Phase 1 and report all system issues immediately.
