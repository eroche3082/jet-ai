MEGAPROMPT GLOBAL DE CIERRE DE FASE (EN INGLÉS)
Agent Status: MISSION-CRITICAL
Objective: Final Pre-Launch Validation & Intelligence Report for Platform Readiness

ORDERS FOR ALL ACTIVE PLATFORMS (Jet AI, CryptoBot, Fitness AI, Sports AI)
Your mission is to perform a complete final audit of your entire platform and confirm readiness for the public release. You must now:

1. VERIFY ALL FIXES FROM PREVIOUS PROMPTS
Go through each section where previous prompts requested fixes, updates, or removals.

Verify that these changes have been correctly implemented.

Provide a checklist confirming:

Copiar
Editar
✅ Completed Fixes  
❌ Unresolved Items  
⚠️ Partially Completed
This includes but is not limited to:

Header navigation functionality

Homepage buttons

Image and content alignment

Chatbot activation and naming

UI visual consistency

Pricing plans and subscription behavior

Dashboard integration (if applicable)

Broken or inactive links

Footer cleanup (no empty pages, fake contacts, or dead links)

2. CONDUCT A FULL SCAN OF THE HOMEPAGE
Validate that every button, link, section, image, and text block is working and responsive.

All components must be aligned with the brand's design and tone.

Remove any content that is placeholder, fake, or redundant.

3. SUBMIT A 3-PART LAUNCH REPORT
Each platform must return the following:

A) WORKING ELEMENTS
Full list of what’s working as expected. Be specific. (Ex: "Explore Destinations button is routing correctly to /destinations.")

B) NON-FUNCTIONAL ITEMS
Any sections or links that are broken, missing, or leading nowhere. No false positives. If it doesn’t work → it goes here.

C) RECOMMENDATIONS
Ideas to elevate the user experience or enhance platform performance. (Ex: “Add a quick-tour onboarding”, “Integrate newsletter popup”, “Refactor navbar for mobile.”)

4. ENFORCE CLARITY AND CLEANLINESS
No dummy data, lorem ipsum, broken icons, or non-functional tabs are allowed.

All external links must be removed unless real and validated.

Branding (name, color, tone) must be consistent across pages.

Any non-approved elements (such as incorrect chatbot names like 'Aurora') must be renamed immediately.

5. DEPLOYMENT GREENLIGHT
Only platforms that complete this full scan and submit the 3-part report will receive the GO signal for deployment.
No platform will move forward without confirmation.
