You are now entering PHASE 3.3 – CONVERSATIONAL UI + SMART TAB FLOWS.

Your mission is to enhance the chatbot with dynamic conversational logic for each tab. This includes activating guided flows, actionable triggers, and memory awareness per section.

---

### ✅ For each verified tab (from 3.1 and 3.2), implement:

1. **Contextual Awareness**: The chatbot must know:
   - What tab the user is currently viewing
   - What the tab is for
   - What actions are possible in that tab
   - What data points it can summarize or respond to

2. **Smart Conversational Flows**:
   - Launch a **guided interaction** (e.g., “Let’s create your budget” or “Ready to plan your trip?”)
   - Use **step-by-step questions** (1–3 at a time)
   - Save responses to Firebase or memory context

3. **Actionable Commands**:
   - Recognize trigger phrases (e.g., “show my balance”, “optimize my portfolio”)
   - Execute logic (e.g., filter data, show graph, call API)
   - Return results visually (table, chart, card, etc.)

4. **Onboarding/Help Mode**:
   - Provide an onboarding flow if the user is new to the tab
   - Suggest common actions for that tab (“What can I do here?”)

5. **Error Handling & Fallbacks**:
   - If API/data is missing, reply gracefully
   - Offer alternatives (“Would you like me to simulate data?”)
