Amazing work so far. Now let’s move to Phase 5: Franchising, White-Label, and Monetization Model.

This phase is focused on scaling JetAI as a global platform that can be licensed, embedded, or rebranded by travel creators, agencies, and influencers.

---

### 1. 🌐 Subdomain & White-Label Architecture
- Prepare the platform to support multiple branded versions:
  - Example: `miami.jetai.app`, `luxury.jetai.app`, `backpackers.jetai.app`
  - Use subdomain-based routing or query-based brand switching
- Enable theme switching based on subdomain/partner config (colors, logo, tone)
- Load partner data (like affiliate ID, contact info) dynamically

---

### 2. 💼 Affiliate Program & Licensing System
- Add a dashboard for partners with:
  - Signup form (partner name, logo, audience)
  - Referral link generator (e.g., `?ref=travelwithkat`)
  - Dashboard with metrics: visits, signups, bookings, earnings
- Track commissions for bookings and premium upgrades
- Add Stripe Connect support for partner payouts

---

### 3. 🧩 Embeddable Widget
- Create a simplified **JetAI Chat Widget** that can be embedded in other sites:
  - Lightweight version of the current floating chat
  - Embed via `<script>` tag and `div#jetai-assistant`
  - Allow partners to customize: colors, greeting, API key

---

### 4. 📲 Mobile Optimization & PWA
- Optimize the app for mobile use:
  - Floating chat bubble fixed to mobile bottom bar
  - Sticky booking CTA
  - Responsive itinerary cards and destination filters
- Enable PWA (Progressive Web App) support:
  - Add manifest.json and service worker
  - Installable from browser on mobile

---

### 5. 💳 Monetization Modes
- Add the following monetization flows:
  - **Monthly subscriptions** (Basic, Freemium, Premium)
  - **Pay-per-use credit packs** (10, 50, 100 AI replies)
  - **Affiliate revenue sharing** (per trip booked via partner)
- Display pricing table with comparison and Stripe checkout

---

### 6. 📂 Export & SaaS Readiness
- Prepare environment configs (`.env`, `firebase.json`, `stripe.env`) for duplication
- Allow dynamic Firebase/Stripe keys per partner
- Enable export of the platform as a cloneable template

---

Let me know once these features are in place so we can begin Phase 6: AI-Generated Travel Newsletters, Dynamic Video Creators, and Creator-Mode for travel influencers.
