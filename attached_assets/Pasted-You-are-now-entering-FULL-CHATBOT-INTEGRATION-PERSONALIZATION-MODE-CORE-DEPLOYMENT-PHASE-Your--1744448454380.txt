You are now entering FULL CHATBOT INTEGRATION & PERSONALIZATION MODE – CORE DEPLOYMENT PHASE.

Your task is to **create, configure, and deploy a fully intelligent, interactive, and dynamic AI chatbot** as the primary interface and controller of this platform. This chatbot must become the **central brain of the system**, capable of onboarding users, personalizing responses, storing structured data, and guiding users across the platform.

---

### ✅ PRIMARY STRUCTURE

1. The chatbot must be **connected to Vertex AI** (Gemini Flash / Chat) as primary AI engine.
2. All responses must be **contextual, personalized, and adaptive**.
3. The chatbot must have a **professional and friendly personality**, acting as a domain expert in the platform’s field (Crypto, Health, Travel, etc.).
4. The chatbot must understand the entire platform: where everything is, how it works, and how to guide new users.

---

### ✅ ONBOARDING FLOW (Dynamic User Profiling)

The chatbot must automatically start with a **progressive, dynamic onboarding** when a new user interacts for the first time:

**QUESTION 1:** “Hi! I’m [AgentName], your assistant. What’s your name?”  
→ Store name as `subscriber.name`

**QUESTION 2:** “Nice to meet you, [Name]! What’s the best email to reach you?”  
→ Store email as `subscriber.email`  
→ Register in Firebase Auth or backend

**QUESTIONS 3–15:** Must adapt to the domain of the platform. For example:

- **CryptoAI:**  
  - “Do you currently invest in crypto?”
  - “Which exchanges do you use?”
  - “What’s your level of experience with DeFi?”

- **HealthAI:**  
  - “Do you track your sleep or steps?”
  - “What’s your biggest health goal right now?”

- **JetAI (Travel):**  
  - “Which cities do you plan to visit next?”
  - “What kind of traveler are you: explorer, relaxer, digital nomad?”

- **FitnessAI:**  
  - “What’s your fitness level?”
  - “Do you want meal recommendations too?”

- **SportsAI:**  
  - “Which sport do you follow most?”
  - “Do you play competitively or for fun?”

---

### ✅ POST-ONBOARDING ACTIONS

After collecting the 10–15 onboarding responses:

- Store all data in the subscriber’s **personal Firebase Dashboard**
- Auto-generate a **personalized Welcome Dashboard**
  - Includes: name, avatar, preferences, chatbot shortcuts, recommended content
- Chatbot should say:  
  “Thanks [Name]! Your personal dashboard has been created. I’ll now assist you based on your profile. Ask me anything.”

---

### ✅ TRAINING & KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION

The chatbot must have embedded platform knowledge:

- How to navigate the dashboard
- What each tab or tool does
- How to use features (e.g., “To track your flights, go to the Travel tab and click ‘Add Destination’”)
- Deliver mini-trainings if asked (“How does the system work?”, “How do I track expenses?”)

---

### ✅ MEMORY, PERSONALIZATION, FOLLOW-UP

- All answers during onboarding must be saved and usable
- Allow the chatbot to **reference past inputs**:
  - “Based on your goal to travel more, here are 3 tools I suggest…”
  - “You mentioned you’re into crypto staking, want to see your current ROI?”
- Allow dashboard to evolve based on new interactions

---

### ✅ FUTURE-PROOF: MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE

Each Agent must have its own instance of this chatbot logic with:

- Different questions per vertical

- Connected to the same system logic

---
