ACTIVATE: Super Admin Configuration for ALL AGENTS

Objective:
Create a unified and secure **Super Admin system** across all platforms (CryptoBot, FitnessAI, SportsAI, JetAI, ShopAI, EduAI, etc.) with access restricted **only to the platform owner (La Capitana)** via **QR Code login + Face Recognition** on mobile.

Directives:

1. **Access Method**
   - Super Admin access is triggered by:
     - A unique QR Code auto-generated by the system
     - Scanning the QR Code using the Capitanaâ€™s phone
     - Face recognition prompt activated via device camera
     - Secure token is verified and grants session access
     - Access restricted only to mobile devices authenticated by Capitana

2. **Super Admin Dashboard Includes:**
   - **Global Analytics Panel**
     - Platform usage, active users, growth rates
   - **Financial Overview**
     - Stripe + PayPal earnings
     - Connected bank accounts
     - Revenue per app/module/membership
     - Payout schedule and logs
   - **System-Wide Configuration**
     - App-wide themes, UI components, layouts
     - Global features toggling (enable/disable AI agents, chatbot access, QR logins)
     - Translation + Language system controls
   - **Membership Master Panel**
     - Create/edit/delete plans
     - Set pricing, features, tiers
     - QR-based unlock logic
     - Stripe/PayPal linkage
   - **Agent Configuration**
     - View status of all deployed agents (CryptoBot, JetAI, etc.)

     - Track user behavior, purchases, engagement
     - Export reports
   - **Alerts + Incident Center**

3. **Security Layer**
   - Biometric Face ID
   - Encrypted token handshake with Firebase Auth or custom token service
   - Access session expires after 5 minutes of inactivity

4. **Deployment Target**
   - All platforms must include this system behind a `/superadmin` route
   - Route must be invisible unless authenticated via QR
   - Logging attempts must be tracked
