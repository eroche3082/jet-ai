You are the integrated system checker and feature validator for the current Agent platform. Begin a comprehensive frontend scan of the ENTIRE HOMEPAGE and LANDING PAGE and generate a detailed report including the following points:

1. **Main Menu Structure**
   - List all tabs: Home, Features, About, Dashboard, Plans, etc.
   - Confirm each tab works, opens correctly, and routes to a functional page
   - Verify all tab labels are in **English**
   - Suggest 3–5 new tabs or reorganizations if needed

2. **Hero Section**
   - Ensure the main Hero Banner includes a clear headline, subheadline, and CTA
   - Validate that CTA buttons (e.g., Get Started, Explore Features) work properly
   - Recommend any image updates or improvements

3. **Features Block**
   - Confirm presence of **at least 20 features** listed in an elegant structure
   - For each feature: confirm there is a title, description, and working icon/image
   - Suggest missing features that should be included based on the Agent's mission

4. **Login & Access**
   - Confirm there is a working **Login Button**
   - Must route to secure login page using:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin123456
   - If no login exists, create one
   - Recommend a way to preview internal dashboards or screenshots on homepage

5. **Live Features Check**
   - For apps like JetAI, confirm Live APIs are working (e.g., hotel search, budget tracking)
   - For SportsAI: confirm live scores, events, ticket integrations are loading
   - Report which APIs are connected and functioning in real-time
   - Flag any APIs missing or throwing errors

6. **CTA Blocks & Membership Plans**
   - Confirm plans are visible on homepage (Basic, Premium, VIP)
   - Validate buttons (Subscribe, Join Now) redirect to correct form or checkout
   - Verify plan descriptions are clear and aligned with backend benefits
   - Confirm user selections are connected to their onboarding code system

7. **Footer Section**
   - Confirm presence of:
     - Contact Info
     - Newsletter signup
     - Terms of Service
     - Social Media Icons (working)
     - Legal links (Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy)
   - Suggest 2 enhancements for footer design/functionality

8. **ChatBot Activation**
   - Verify ChatBot is showing in bottom right corner
   - Confirm onboarding question flow works (10 questions with categories)
   - Must be connected to **Gemini Flash via Vertex AI**
   - Confirm language translation via Google Translate API (multi-language support)
   - Confirm output is clean, properly formatted, in English (with option to switch)

9. **Media Content**
   - Ensure all blocks contain active images/videos
   - If blocks are empty or show outdated assets, suggest image replacements
   - If needed, insert previews or screenshots of dashboard inside homepage

10. **Smart Suggestions**
   - For each Agent, suggest **5 improvements** or features that could elevate the homepage experience
   - Suggestions may include:
     - New interactive blocks
     - Gamification
     - AI-generated testimonials
     - Product demos
     - Scroll-based animations

**Expected Output:**
- JSON or Markdown-style system report
- Categorized as:
  - ✅ Functioning
  - ❌ Broken or missing
  - ⚠️ Needs enhancement
- Include image recommendations, API check status, link validation results, and proposed new UX ideas

This prompt should be executed internally by each Agent. The Agent must not request approval — it must **scan and act autonomously**. Once completed, each Agent should submit a report for review titled:

**“[AGENT NAME] – HOMEPAGE SCAN & FEATURE STATUS REPORT (Phase 3)”**

¿Activamos esto ya mismo para todos los Agents? ¿O prefieres que prepare un comando por app para activarlos en fila?
