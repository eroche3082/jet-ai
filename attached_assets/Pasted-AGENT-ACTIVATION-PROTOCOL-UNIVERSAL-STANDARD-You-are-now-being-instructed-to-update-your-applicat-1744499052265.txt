AGENT ACTIVATION PROTOCOL – UNIVERSAL STANDARD

You are now being instructed to update your application with the following **unified layout and system protocol** across all platforms.

---

### 1. **LANDING PAGE (Main Page) STRUCTURE**

Create a professional, responsive landing page for your platform with the following:

- **Top Navigation Bar**
  - Left: Logo and Platform Name
  - Right: "Login" Button

- **Hero Section**
  - Background image or video relevant to the platform (travel, crypto, education, etc.)
  - Bold headline describing the main value of the app (e.g., “Discover Your Perfect Journey with AI”)

- **Features Section**
  - List all **20 core features** of your app (as defined in your AI Chat feature list)
  - Each feature must include:
    - Title
    - One-line description
    - Optional icon or image
  - Display in a clean 2–3 column responsive layout

- **About / Mission Section**
  - Short paragraph describing what your app does and why it exists

- **Call to Action Section**
  - Buttons: [Get Started] [Explore] [Chat with Assistant]

- **Footer**
  - Terms, Privacy, Copyright (e.g., © 2025 YourPlatformName AI. All rights reserved.)

The landing page must be in **English only** and styled with modern UI principles (rounded cards, gradients, etc.).

---

### 2. **LOGIN SYSTEM**

Implement a basic login system with the following rules:

- No password creation system. Only login via username/password
- Default credentials for all platforms:
  - **Username:** `admin`
  - **Password:** `admin123456`
- Skip signup logic for now — just hardcode this super admin login
- Login should redirect directly to the main app platform (dashboard with side panel)

---

### 3. **MAIN PLATFORM STRUCTURE**

Upon login, show:

- **Left Side Panel** with tabs:
  - Scrollable with fixed width (e.g., 260px)
  - Ensure all links are visible, even on small screens
  - Add scroll and proper z-index

- **Main Content Panel**
  - Must have `margin-left: 260px` or equivalent spacing
  - Verify every tab has working routes and data
  - Fix overlap or layout break issues (as seen in Subjects, Learning Resources, etc.)

---

### 4. **FULL STRUCTURE & VISUAL CHECK**

Run a **full validation** of the platform layout and functionality:

- Ensure **scroll works** both in sidebar and main page
- Ensure all **tabs render complete UI content**
- Merge **redundant tabs** (e.g., if two tabs show similar data)
- Validate responsive behavior (desktop + mobile)
- Check that **all buttons** on all pages are working
- If a tab is empty or placeholder, show `Coming Soon` badge

---

### 5. **DELIVERABLES FOR EACH AGENT**

Each platform should now include:

- ✅ Landing Page (Main Page) with 20 feature breakdown
- ✅ Login System (admin / admin123456)
- ✅ Dashboard Structure with working Tabs
- ✅ AI Assistant Chat as a core module
- ✅ Fully functional UI with scroll + spacing fixed
- ✅ Tab optimization: no duplications, coherent naming

---

PRIORITY:
- Do **not** overwrite existing functional components
- Only **add missing structure, fix layout, and link all systems**
- Use your intelligence to adapt visual content (icons, videos) to your platform domain

---

CONFIRM IMPLEMENTATION STATUS VIA:
- `/status/landing`
- `/status/login`
- `/status/structure`
- `/status/chat`

Once confirmed, report back to central command.

MISSION: UNIFY, POLISH, DEPLOY.
