MEGAPROMPT — JETAI DASHBOARD CORE MODULE ACTIVATION & ORGANIZATION THREAD
ROLE:
You are the JetAI Interface Operations Agent, assigned to Phase 5: Dashboard System Activation & UX Integrity. Your mission is to:

Activate and validate every tab and navigation link in the left and top navigation bar.

Ensure each tab has functional content, correctly routed pages, and dynamic AI-powered features.

Avoid messy layout overflow — this dashboard must remain elegant, modular, and consistent across all viewports.

You must also maintain UX hierarchy, responsive scaling, and fast-loading interfaces.

PART 1 – TAB ACTIVATION DIRECTIVE
TABS TO ACTIVATE (LEFT NAVIGATION):
Dashboard:
Show overview stats (Destinations visited, Upcoming Trips, Budget, Points), trip highlights, and AI suggestions based on user history.

Explore:
Display curated global destinations with filters (budget, interest, safety, season, vibe).
Connect to AI recommendation engine.

Trips:
Load all past and upcoming trips. Include options to view, edit, cancel, duplicate itineraries.
Show trip status and associated budget progress.

Destinations:
Load AI destination profiles with:

Best time to go

Entry requirements

Local culture & safety tips

Visa & vaccination details

Cuisine, events, and language guides

Itineraries:
Interactive itinerary builder (day-by-day planner).
Editable blocks with AI auto-fill from preferences.
Drag & drop UI with Google Maps/Places integration.

Accommodations:
Show personalized lodging matches. Filterable by style, budget, amenities.
Connect to Booking, Airbnb, Hostelworld APIs.

Dining:
Load recommended restaurants per destination.
Filters: vegan, luxury, cheap eats, locals only, Michelin.
Include AI-powered food tours and table reservation links.

Highlight top moments, cities, meals, and emotional trends (via sentiment analysis).

Rewards & Loyalty:

PART 2 – TOP NAVIGATION BAR TABS
Destinations: Same as left nav.

Travel Blog: Show dynamic articles, AI-generated guides, community posts.

Features: Pull from FeaturesPage.tsx – display all 25+ JetAI features.

Travel Community: Load community posts, likes, groups, travel buddies.

PART 3 – FUNCTIONAL VALIDATION AND HOOKS
For each tab:

Verify route is functional (/dashboard, /explore, etc.)

Ensure all buttons, dropdowns, filters, and embedded maps are interactive

Connect to backend API where needed

Ensure state preservation via context or localStorage (esp. for itineraries, budgets)

PART 4 – UI STRUCTURE & ORDERING GUIDELINES
Left Panel = Navigation only
→ Do not overload it with widgets or media

Top Bar = Global navigation (switch tabs, profile, logout)

Center Panel = Dynamic content only
→ Tabs load modular React components, not full-page reloads

AI Assistant (bottom right) = Fixed chat icon, auto-summons based on user actions

PART 5 – TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
Responsive layout using Flex/Grid

Preload animations on async data fetching

Code-splitting for faster tab switch

Use centralized route manager (e.g. React Router)

Track component states and UI transitions (e.g. loading, empty, error)

✅ GOAL:
"Create a highly functional, AI-powered, modular dashboard where every tab is interactive, responsive, and connected to real data and services. Maintain elegant structure, no visual overflow, and empower each component to operate independently yet cohesively."
