MEGAPROMPT – UNIVERSAL AGENT ONBOARDING + CODE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

You are the AI assistant for a Next Generation Platform powered by Gemini Flash and Vertex AI.

Your mission is to activate a smart onboarding system on the public frontend chatbot (bottom right icon) with the following structure and behavior:

1. Frontend Chatbot Behavior
Display only one chatbot icon in the bottom-right corner.

When opened, the chatbot will not redirect to another page. It will conduct a 10-step conversation.

First Question: What's your name?

Second Question: What's your email?

Next 8 Questions: Must be tailored to the platform’s niche using multiple selection format. Example:

For Edu-AI: level of education, preferred learning style, interest in STEM, etc.

For Fitness-AI: fitness goals, body type, preferred workouts, past injuries, etc.

For Jet-AI: travel frequency, favorite continents, hotel preferences, budget, etc.

2. AI-Based Categorization & Code Generation
After answering all 10 questions, the system must:

Analyze the answers using Vertex AI.

Categorize the user into a specific “level” (ex: Beginner, Advanced, VIP, Frequent Traveler, etc.)

Generate a unique alphanumeric CODE (example: EDU-VIP-8457) based on platform, category, and session.

Optionally, generate a QR Code that can be scanned to reach the personalized dashboard.

Display a loading message: Loading your personalized dashboard…

3. Redirection & Dashboard Activation
After the code is generated:

User is redirected to a form to enter their CODE (instead of traditional login).

Upon entering the CODE, the system will:

Unlock a personalized dashboard within the existing backend structure (NO new dashboards should be created).

Inject the user’s data, preferences, and features unlocked into the Home tab of the current dashboard.

Add a section labeled “Your Journey” showing:

The 3 unlocked free levels.

The remaining locked levels.

Option to unlock additional levels via QR Code or direct payment.

4. Newsletter, Leads & Tracking
The chatbot must store name + email + code + preferences in a leads list connected to the Admin Panel.

This list will be used for:

Targeted newsletter campaigns (HubSpot or internal system).

Referral systems (CODE doubles as referral ID).

Analytics & upgrade nudges.

5. User Payment System (Future Phase)
Each CODE should also:

Be tied to payment actions (QR Code on mobile can trigger Apple Pay/Stripe/Google Pay).

Unlock paid features or levels in the dashboard once payment is confirmed.

Be linked to future features like invite friends, affiliate tracking, or loyalty programs.

NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

All Agents must follow this exact structure.

Remove any duplicate chats, onboarding popups, or unnecessary “Create Profile” buttons.

The entire onboarding flow and code system must be functional before any dashboard customization or internal access.

All chats must be powered by Vertex AI / Gemini Flash, with real-time reasoning and categorization.
