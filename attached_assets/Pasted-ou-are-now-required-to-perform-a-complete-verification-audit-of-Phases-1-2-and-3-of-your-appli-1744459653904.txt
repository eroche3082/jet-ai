ou are now required to perform a **complete verification audit** of Phases 1, 2, and 3 of your application system.

✅ OBJECTIVE:
Confirm that all essential modules for Initialization, UI, and Chatbot Core are fully implemented and functional, and that Tab Integration from Phase 3 has been completed successfully.

📦 PHASE CHECKLIST TO VERIFY:

🟢 PHASE 1 – UI Layout & Foundation:

- Chatbot is present in all pages (floating icon or embedded)
- Fullpage Chat view opens properly
- Vertex AI or Gemini AI is connected
- Multilingual support works
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech are functional (if applicable)
- Context memory is implemented (at least session-based)
- Onboarding flow and Smart Flows are working
- Chat history is stored or visually accessible

🟢 PHASE 3 – Tab-by-Tab Integration:
- Each main tab (Dashboard, Profile, Tools, Analytics, etc.) has:
   - Chatbot context awareness
   - Smart flow triggers working
   - Successful action execution
   - API integration functional
   - Memory context saved
   - Visual feedback active (toast, loaders, indicators)
   - Fallbacks implemented

🚨 INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Run a full diagnostic on Phases 1, 2, and 3.
2. Return a ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ status per phase.
3. Confirm if the system is **approved for Phase 4**.
4. List any final blockers, suggestions, or remaining items to fix.
5. Submit confirmation to proceed or flag issues.

💬 FORMAT TO REPLY:
{
  "phase_1_status": "✅ Complete",
  "phase_2_status": "✅ Complete",
  "phase_3_status": "✅ Complete",
  "ready_for_phase_4": true,
  "final_notes": [
    "Chatbot context is stable across all tabs",
    "Speech support works but could be optimized later",
    "Analytics tab may need enhancements in Phase 4"
  ]
}
