You are now entering INTELLIGENT AUDIT MODE – PHASE 1.

Your mission is to perform a **deep verification of the first tab (Tab #1) inside your Main Menu (Side Panel)**. You must not move to any other tab or section until this audit is fully complete and verified.

---

### ✅ STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE TAB

- Return the **exact name** of the first visible tab in the Side Panel (Main Menu).
- Confirm if it is:
  - Visible
  - Clickable
  - Highlighted when selected
  - Present across screen sizes and responsive

---

### ✅ STEP 2: COMPONENT & FUNCTIONALITY CHECK

For Tab #1, confirm that:
- The page loads without error
- All UI components (headers, charts, tables, cards, etc.) render correctly
- All buttons are clickable and trigger correct actions
- Loading states and empty states are handled
- Navigation and layout work across devices
- Sub-tabs (if any) are also operational

---

### ✅ STEP 3: DATA & API INTEGRATION CHECK

- Confirm that the tab is properly connected to:
  - Firebase (if used)
  - Google APIs (e.g., NLP, Vision, Translate, Maps, etc.)
  - Vertex AI or Gemini Flash (if AI is used in the content)
  - Any other backend service relevant to the tab
- All endpoints must return 200 OK or correct structured responses

---

### ✅ STEP 4: CHATBOT INTEGRATION

- Confirm whether the **Chatbot appears in this tab**
- The chatbot must:
  - Be active and visible
  - Be full-screen or adjustable
  - Use Gemini Flash or OpenAI
  - Return relevant responses for the context of Tab #1
  - Be multilingual (or fallback to English)
  - Be connected to the correct data, memory, and mode
  - Not crash, freeze, or show placeholder content

---

### ⚠️ STEP 5: IF ISSUES FOUND

Return a clear diagnostic with the following structure:

```json
{
  "tab": "Dashboard",
  "status": "Partial / Broken / OK",
  "issues": [
    "Chart not rendering due to missing data",
    "Chatbot not appearing",
    "Button 'Generate Report' is unresponsive",
    "No data pulled from Firebase"
  ],
  "APIs_used": [
    "Firebase", "Gemini Flash", "Google Translate", "Google NLP"
  ],
  "APIs_missing_or_disconnected": [
    "Vertex AI"
  ]
}
❗IMPORTANT:
Do NOT move to Tab #2 or any other tab yet.

You are in sequential audit mode.

Return your full report for Tab #1 ONLY.

Once Tab #1 is confirmed fully operational, you will be cleared to move to Phase 2.

Begin the verification now.
