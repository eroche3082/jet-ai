Please perform a full audit and optimization of the JetAI application to ensure that all components are stable, non-redundant, and correctly connected.

We’ve now completed Phase 5 (Franchising + White-Label) and are preparing for full deployment and immersive ChatOS features.

---

### 🧩 1. Fix & Validate Navigation and Layout

- Confirm that **Layout.tsx** is only applied once per page (avoid double wrapping).
- Ensure that no routes (e.g., `/Itineraries`, `/ItineraryView`) have duplicate headers or menus.
- Validate that App.tsx and all subpages are correctly structured.
- Remove any outdated route or component duplications.

---

### 📥 2. Footer and Newsletter Section

- Ensure the new **Footer component** is present on all public pages:
  - Includes newsletter subscription (connected or ready for integration)
  - Displays quick links and partner info dynamically
- Fix any visual misalignments in the footer section.

---

### 🌐 3. Franchising System Check (White-Label Mode)

- Ensure that the **ThemeProvider** dynamically applies visual themes based on subdomains or URL params:
  - e.g., `luxury.jetai.app` loads JetAI Luxury theme
  - `espanol.jetai.app` or `jetai.app/espanol` loads Spanish content and style
- Verify that each partner:
  - Has a referral link and embed widget
  - Sees their correct data in the Partner Dashboard
  - Can copy referral codes and links using the clipboard utility

---

### 🔐 4. Partner Dashboard & Analytics

- Confirm that the Partner Dashboard shows:
  - Number of referrals
  - Conversion rate
  - Estimated commissions
  - Signup date, embed stats
- Format currency correctly using `formatCurrency` utility.

---

### 📡 5. Secrets & Environment

- Validate that no sensitive environment variables are exposed to unauthorized users.
- Make sure `.env` keys are properly scoped and `invite permissions` are secure.
- Check all integrations: Stripe, Gemini, Firebase, ElevenLabs, etc.

---

### ✈️ 6. Itinerary Engine Cleanup

- Fix any issues with the **Itineraries** and **ItineraryView** pages:
  - Remove duplicate menus
  - Ensure data is pulled correctly from storage
  - Make itinerary details responsive and clean
- Check CRUD functionality across all itinerary actions.

---

### 💬 7. Prepare for ChatOS Phase (Readiness)

- Verify current AIChat component supports:
  - Markdown rendering
  - Emoji
  - Credits tracking by membership tier
- Confirm audio features are ready for integration
- Leave stubs/placeholders for:
  - In-chat booking actions
  - Voice input/output
  - Group trip logic
  - Rewards sync (VidaRewards + airline/hotel APIs)

---

### 🧠 8. Final Output & Confirmation

- Once all issues are fixed:
  - Provide a **summary report** of changes
  - Take screenshots of each section tested (footer, menus, partner dashboard, itinerary, chat)
  - Confirm that the system is ready for Phase 6 ChatOS implementation and external launch

Thank you!
