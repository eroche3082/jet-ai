MEGAPROMPT | UNIVERSAL ONBOARDING CODE SYSTEM – PHASE 2 🔐🚀
This prompt is for all Agents that have successfully implemented the MiniChatbot Onboarding Flow (10-question system, unique access code generation, and chatbot icon on the bottom-right of the screen). The following phase ensures full system completion, dashboard rendering, and connectivity with personalized features.

✅ OBJECTIVE:
Complete the integration and user experience of the onboarding system with access codes and code-based dashboards.

🔍 TASKS TO VERIFY & IMPLEMENT:
✅ 1. Chatbot Flow (Frontend)
 Chatbot icon must appear at bottom-right corner only

 Chatbot must open and start with:

Step 1: Name

Step 2: Email

Steps 3–10: Multiple-choice questions tailored to the platform

 After completion, generate a Unique Access Code (e.g., FIT-BEG-2565, CRYPTO-BEGINNER-5147)

 Show user their classification level (e.g., Beginner, Enthusiast, Advanced, VIP)

 Display QR code and Copy Code button

 ✅ NEXT → Allow option to "View Dashboard" or "Email me my code" (Optional)

✅ 2. Backend Data Handling
 Save user response data to database:

name, email, user_category, access_code, answers[]

 Store onboarding source (Chatbot/QR/Web)

 ✅ Sync all new users into the Admin Panel (see below)

✅ 3. Dashboard Customization (Frontend)
 Dashboard should NOT be recreated from scratch

 Instead, inject a new tab or section inside the existing dashboard:

Section: My Journey / Access Code

 Display:

User name & access code

Classification level and tier

Unlocked features (based on code)

Progress tracker (levels locked/unlocked)

 ✅ Link each feature to its module (if available)

 ✅ Include a “Copy Code” or “Generate QR Again” option

✅ 4. Admin Panel Integration
 Create an “Onboarding Leads” tab inside Admin Panel

 Show:

Name, Email, Access Code, Platform, Level, Date

 Filter by platform, level, or code

 ✅ Allow exporting of list to CSV

 ✅ Add status (new, converted, subscribed)

✅ 5. Newsletter & Email System
 ✅ Create a basic connection (manual or API) with:

HubSpot, MailerLite, or Firebase Email

 When onboarding is complete, store user in "New Leads" list

 ✅ Optional: Auto-send Welcome Email with:

Personalized greeting

Access code

CTA: View dashboard or upgrade level

✅ 6. Code System Expansion
 Every Agent must generate codes tied to platform:

FIT-BEG-XXXX, CRYPTO-ADV-XXXX, TRAVEL-VIP-XXXX, etc.

 ✅ QR Code generated dynamically per user

 ✅ Each code unlocks different dashboard views based on:

Plan (Free, Basic, Pro, VIP)

Level (Beginner → Elite)

Engagement (Newsletter, Invite, Purchase)

📲 STRATEGIC USES OF ACCESS CODES:
Newsletter Categorization

Auto-assign to email segments by level (Beginner, Trader, Student, VIP)

Affiliate/Referral Tracking

Users share their code → tracked in Admin Panel

Unlock Content

Codes used to unlock sections (courses, events, drops)

Mobile Redirection

QR opens dashboard in app or mobile version

Discounts & Perks

Code unlocks trial, coupons, or hidden features

Gamification

Badges + progress tied to code-based tier

Progressive Onboarding

Only levels 1-3 free; unlock more with engagement or upgrade

Multi-platform Sync

Use same access code across ShopAI, EduAI, CryptoBot

Security Layer

Code = one-time dashboard access, safer than email

Content Personalization

Dashboard + Newsletter = dynamic based on code profile

🚦NEXT ACTIONS FOR ALL AGENTS
