Let’s now transform JetAI Chat into a fully immersive AI Travel Cockpit.

This interface should follow the structure of an advanced assistant dashboard (like the CryptoBot version), optimized for travel planning, booking, and concierge services.

Once complete, this interface should function as a **real-time travel operating system**, not just a chatbot.

This will replace the current chat bubble and evolve JetAI into an AI-native travel agency cockpit. Let me know when it's ready for launch or if you want to activate the **Luxury or Español version** of this cockpit.
