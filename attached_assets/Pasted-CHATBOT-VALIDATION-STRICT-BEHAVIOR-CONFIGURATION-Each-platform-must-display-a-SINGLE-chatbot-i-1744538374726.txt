✅ This icon must be clickable, expand into a floating chat window, and closable.

❌ If there is more than one chatbot instance, REMOVE all duplicates.

✅ Chatbot must open a structured onboarding flow, not a freestyle or broken prompt.

“What’s your name?”

“What’s your email?”

Then proceed with 10–15 smart questions, based on platform category (fitness, finance, crypto, etc.) using multiple selection components.
