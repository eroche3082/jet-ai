The core system is now secure, responsive, monetized, and modular. Let’s activate Phase 6: ChatOS – a fully immersive, AI-powered conversational interface for travel planning, bookings, and beyond.

Please begin implementing the following:

---

### 1. Conversational Flow Upgrade

- Migrate chat logic to **one question at a time** format
- Store temporary answers (location, budget, duration, companions, preferences)
- Enable follow-up corrections ("Change my destination to Greece")
- Support **multi-select options** (checkboxes, pill buttons)

---

### 2. Audio & Visual Features

- Add **voice input** using Speech-to-Text
- Enable **Text-to-Speech** response mode with mute/play toggle
- Support image uploads and photo replies (optional webcam integration)
- Leave placeholder for future **video call / avatar response mode**

---

### 3. Booking Inside Chat

- Integrate smart buttons for:
  - "Book Flight" → modal with dates, airports, cost
  - "Find Hotel" → card responses with selection option
- Checkout process powered by Stripe
- Display confirmation and attach booking to user profile

---

### 4. Rewards Engine

- Add dynamic reward display inside the chat:
  - Show JetAI VidaPoints, Airline Miles, Hotel Points
- Allow usage of points as partial payment
- Include simple `/rewards` command or button

---

### 5. Group Travel Flow

- User can invite others to plan together
- Chat collects preferences from all members
- AI merges data to create a shared itinerary
- Show dynamic voting (e.g. restaurants, excursions)

---

### 6. Dashboard Sync

- Add quick commands inside chat:
  - “Show my itinerary”
  - “Edit profile”
  - “Upgrade membership”
  - “Check my rewards”
- Open embedded views (drawers/modals or dashboard panels)

---

### 7. Visual & UX Polish

- Markdown + emoji formatting
- Smart notifications (“You're out of credits” / “Your booking was confirmed!”)
- Mobile UX with fixed bottom chat input, responsive cards
- Add loading animations (typing dots, transitions)

---

### Optional: Creator Expansion Mode

If requested, prep buttons or tabs for JetAI modes:
- JetAI Español
- JetAI Luxury
- JetAI Digital Nomads
Each with its own theme, greeting, and behavior

Let me know when all parts are complete so we can launch Phase 7: **Creator Tools + Avatar + Live Concierge AI**.
