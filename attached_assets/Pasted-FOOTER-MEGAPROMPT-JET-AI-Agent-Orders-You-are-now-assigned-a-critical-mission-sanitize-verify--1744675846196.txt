Agent Orders:

You are now assigned a critical mission: sanitize, verify, and finalize the entire footer of the Jet AI Travel Companion platform. This section must meet elite-level standards of accuracy, professionalism, and functionality.

1. SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS
 Verify the links for Instagram, Twitter (X), Facebook, YouTube.

 REMOVE any icon that:

Is linked to #, empty path, or placeholder

Is not connected to a real, verified social media account

2. "Navigation" COLUMN
You must verify all listed links:

Home → Ensure it's connected to the homepage

Destinations → Must scroll or navigate to the destinations section

Travel Journal → Must open the blog or articles section

About Jet AI → Only keep if a real page or modal is implemented

If any link leads nowhere → REMOVE IMMEDIATELY

3. "Services" COLUMN

Action Required:

Each must link to a real page, scroll section, or active feature.

If any is a placeholder or "coming soon", either remove or disable it.

4. "Connect" COLUMN
concierge@jetai.travel → Verify this is a real, monitored email. If not, replace with support@jetai.com or REMOVE.

Live Assistance Available → If this opens a chat or assistant window, keep it. Otherwise, disable or comment it out.

5. SUBSCRIBE SECTION
Ensure the email subscribe box works:

Sends data to a working backend or mail integration (e.g., SendGrid, Mailchimp)

Confirmation or success message appears after submission

If backend is not functional → REMOVE or DISABLE TEMPORARILY

 No overlapping elements or broken layout on small screens
