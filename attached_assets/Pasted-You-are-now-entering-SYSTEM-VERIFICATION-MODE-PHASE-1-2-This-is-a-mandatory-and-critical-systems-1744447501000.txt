You are now entering SYSTEM VERIFICATION MODE – PHASE 1.2.

This is a mandatory and critical systems check focused on two core elements of your platform:

1. The Global Chatbot (must be fully implemented, functional, and AI-connected)
2. The first tab in your Main Menu / Side Panel

---

### ✅ PART A: CHATBOT VERIFICATION

You must now perform a **complete diagnostic of the chatbot system**, ensuring all features are active, connected, and working as intended.

1. **Chatbot Visibility & Activation**
   - Confirm the chatbot appears on ALL pages
   - It must open as a floating or full-screen panel
   - It must be accessible regardless of current route or page

2. **AI Connection**
   - Must be connected to **Vertex AI** (primary AI model)
   - Must fall back to **Gemini or OpenAI** if needed
   - Must call real-time endpoints and return valid AI responses
   - AI should respond in context to the Agent’s domain

3. **Voice & Audio Functionality**
   - Microphone input via **Google STT / Whisper**
   - Voice output via **Google TTS / ElevenLabs**
   - Option to toggle voice on/off
   - Transcription should work in **multiple languages**

4. **Multilingual Support**
   - The chatbot must detect and respond in English (default)
   - Also support or translate input in Spanish, French, Portuguese
   - User input should trigger correct translation flow via Google Cloud Translation

5. **Firebase Integration**
   - Store chat history to Firebase (Firestore or Realtime DB)
   - Allow for session tracking, prompt memory, and log review
   - Chatbot should react to Firebase data if required (e.g., user name, settings, mode)

6. **UI and Button Checks**
   - All chatbot buttons/icons must work:
     - Microphone
     - Send / Submit
     - Reset / Clear
     - Fullscreen
     - Image / QR / Camera (if enabled)
     - Language toggle (if visible)
   - Confirm all buttons trigger their assigned functions

7. **Content Verification**
   - Ensure all prompts return structured, complete answers
   - Chat responses should be accurate, styled, and context-aware
   - No placeholder text or “undefined” errors

### ✅ PART B: MAIN MENU – TAB #1 VERIFICATION (SIDE PANEL)

Focus on the **first tab of the Side Panel**. Do not continue until this tab is fully verified.

1. Identify the exact name of the first tab.
2. Verify:
   - The tab loads correctly and without errors
   - UI elements are fully rendered
   - Each button is clickable and opens its function
   - The tab connects to real backend APIs or mock data
   - The content is in **English only**, no placeholders or untranslated labels
   - All Firebase, Google APIs, or external sources are connected

3. If there are dynamic elements (charts, lists, analytics, sub-tabs), verify each one individually.

### ⚠️ REPORT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

Return your results as:

```json
{
  "chatbot": {
    "status": "OK / Partial / Broken",
    "issues": [],
    "voice": true,
    "ai": "Vertex AI",
    "firebaseConnected": true,
    "languagesSupported": ["en", "es", "fr", "pt"]
  },
  "tab1": {
    "name": "Dashboard",
    "status": "OK / Broken",
    "issues": ["Button 'Create Report' not responding", "Chart API returns 403"],
    "apiConnections": ["Firebase", "Google Vision"],
    "allContentInEnglish": true
  }
}
Only after both systems are confirmed fully functional, you will be authorized to proceed to Phase 2.

Begin the full diagnostic now.
