Great job on implementing Gemini 1.5 Flash, fallback handling, markdown support, and user preference analysis. Now let's move on to Phase 3: Premium Membership System and Smart Booking Engine.

Here’s what to implement next:

---

### 🛡️ 1. Membership & Authentication System
- Add authentication with Google and email/password (Firebase or custom).
- Allow users to save favorite destinations, activities, and trips.
- Create two tiers:
  - Free user → limited chat interactions and basic itinerary features.
  - Premium user → unlimited chat, AI-generated itineraries, booking access.
- Add UI to show membership status and an upgrade button.

---

### 🧭 2. AI-Generated Smart Itinerary Engine
- When a user selects a destination or types it in the chat:
  - Generate a multi-day itinerary (based on their profile and preferences).
  - Use Google Places, OpenWeather, and Yelp APIs to suggest real-time activities.
  - Each day should include:
    - Morning, afternoon, evening plans
    - Duration estimates, travel time, budget estimate
- Render this visually in a card or expandable day-by-day view.

---

### 💳 3. AI-Powered Booking Flow
- Connect the experience cards with a “Book Now” button.
- When clicked:
  - Show a summary (image, price, availability, location, reviews)
  - Let user confirm and proceed to Stripe checkout.
  - After payment, send confirmation via email (if mail API is connected) or show success page.
- Allow free-tier users to preview but require upgrade to Premium to proceed with booking.

---

### 🧠 4. Personal AI Dashboard
- Create a "My Trips" page:
  - Saved destinations
  - Past itineraries
  - Upcoming bookings
- Include a sidebar or floating widget showing:
  - Budget usage
  - Travel style score
  - AI suggestions for next trip based on travel behavior

---

### ✅ 5. Final Adjustments
- Fix any chat inconsistencies.
- Ensure persistent user session handling.
- Modularize new features for easy reuse in upcoming clones (e.g., JetAI for Business, Events, Retreats).
- Prepare export version of this project with backup of the `.env`, `package.json`, and deployment settings.

Let me know when this is complete so we can begin Phase 4: JetAI Franchising Model, which will include location-based subdomains, affiliate commission system, and embeddable travel planners.

Thank you again!
