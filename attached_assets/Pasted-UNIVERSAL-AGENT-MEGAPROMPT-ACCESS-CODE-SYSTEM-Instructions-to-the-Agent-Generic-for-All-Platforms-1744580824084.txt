UNIVERSAL AGENT MEGAPROMPT â€” ACCESS CODE SYSTEM
Instructions to the Agent (Generic for All Platforms):

You are now responsible for managing and executing the Universal Access Code System for your application. This includes generating onboarding codes, rendering QR access, enabling dashboard personalization, processing payments via Stripe, and supporting referral and tracking logic.

Follow the steps below and verify that all are functional:

PHASE 1: Onboarding Access Code Generation
When the user finishes the onboarding flow, generate a unique access code using the format:

css
Copiar
Editar
[PLATFORM]-[CATEGORY]-[LANGUAGE_CODE]-[RANDOM_NUMBER]
Example: FIT-PRO-EN-8471, TRAVEL-VIP-ES-2890, SHOP-BASIC-EN-0923

Save the following data:

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "userId": "auto-generated",
  "accessCode": "TRAVEL-VIP-ES-2890",
  "platform": "JetAI",
  "category": "VIP",
  "language": "ES",
  "level": "Beginner",
  "unlockedLevels": ["Level 1", "Level 2"],
  "referrals": [],
  "createdAt": Timestamp
}
PHASE 2: QR Code Integration
Generate a QR Code that links to:

arduino
Copiar
Editar
https://[platform].app/dashboard?code=ACCESS_CODE
Display the QR Code on screen and send it in a confirmation email using the existing email system (SendGrid, Firebase, or EmailJS).

Ensure the QR is mobile-optimized and scan-ready.

PHASE 3: Dashboard Access via Code
When a user lands on the platform with a ?code=XYZ in the URL:

Automatically log them in

Load their personalized dashboard using the information tied to that code

Show their journey, progress, and unlocked features

PHASE 4: Level Unlock System
Inside the dashboard, display "locked" levels

Allow unlocking via:

Promo code input

Stripe payment

Integrate Stripe with the appropriate price ID per level:

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "level": "Level 4",
  "priceId": "price_1ABC234567890"
}
Upon successful payment, update unlockedLevels in Firestore or your DB.

PHASE 5: Admin Panel Tracking
Implement a protected admin route /admin

Use the credentials:

username: admin

password: admin123456

The admin dashboard must display:

All access codes issued

User activity per code

Payments made

Referral stats

CSV export option

PHASE 6: Referral + Sharing System
Allow the user to share their access code with friends

If the code is used during onboarding by another user, update:

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "referrerCode": "FIT-PRO-8471",
  "referrals": ["USER_ID_2", "USER_ID_3"]
}
Add rewardPoints to the referrer, based on platform logic

PHASE 7: Final Checklist
Before confirming completion, verify:
