EXTENDED SYSTEM-WIDE VALIDATION MEGA PROMPT – FOR ALL AGENTS
MISSION:
Conduct a full diagnostic, audit, and optimization scan of your entire platform – frontend, backend, AI services, UI/UX, payments, onboarding, memberships, chat, and all user flows. You must use the activated Google Cloud API services, confirm the usage of the correct API key, and report the entire system status, with fixes and suggestions.

1. SYSTEM ACCESS & API CONFIGURATION
You are authorized to use the following global API Key for all services:

ts
Copiar
Editar
process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY = "AIzaSyA--rn_uJjZtyU9kGpIWDpBa-obvtPrC24";
Verify that all your API calls and system modules are routed through this key. Services that must be validated:

Vertex AI / Gemini

Cloud Vision API

Cloud Translation API

Cloud Speech-to-Text API

Cloud Text-to-Speech API

Cloud Natural Language API

Firebase APIs (Firestore, Auth, Hosting)

Stripe API (for subscriptions and payments)

SendGrid Email API (for onboarding and verification)

2. FRONTEND & UI/UX STRUCTURE CHECK
You must validate every visible section of the public platform and dashboard:

a. Main Menu & Navigation
Are all main menu tabs present and clickable?

Do all tabs link to functional and populated pages?

Are hover states, dropdowns, and mobile nav working?

b. Hero Section
Is the hero image/video loading properly?

Do the CTA buttons work? ("Get Started", "Join", etc.)

Is the language and copy clear, on-brand, and engaging?

c. Features Section
Are all 20 features listed and properly described?

Do each feature blocks include icons, titles, and working animations or transitions?

If hover or carousel elements exist, are they responsive?

d. Membership Section
Are plans clearly labeled (e.g., Basic, Premium, VIP)?

Are all buttons leading to Stripe or payment flows?

Is the plan logic connected to the Access Code system?

e. Footer Section
Are legal links working? (Privacy Policy, Terms)

Are newsletter or email forms working?

Are social media links valid and opening external pages?

Is the language selector working for multilingual mode?

3. CHATBOT FUNCTIONALITY
The AI Assistant should be:

Visible and clickable on every page (bottom-right corner)

Connected to Vertex AI / Gemini

Able to answer onboarding, technical, and service-related questions

Have access to:

onboarding flow (10-step system)

access code generation

membership plan logic

content unlocking via QR or code

You must also confirm:

Chatbot starts with a welcome message

Multilingual functionality works via Google Translate API

Typing indicators and smooth animations are present

Memory/context system is working (local or cloud-based)

4. BACKEND & DATABASE INTEGRITY
Verify:

User data is stored correctly in Firebase, Firestore or PostgreSQL

All user levels (Basic, Premium, VIP) have corresponding access logic

Admin Dashboard (if implemented) is accessible via /admin

Admin credentials:

Username: admin

Password: admin123456

Admin dashboard can display user activity, codes issued, and analytics

5. API INTEGRATIONS VALIDATION
Check and test each API endpoint:

Google Cloud Services (Vision, TTS, STT, Translation, NLP)

Stripe Checkout and Webhooks

QR Code Generator

Access Code Verification System

Firebase Hosting, Auth, and Firestore

SendGrid or EmailJS for onboarding and confirmation

External APIs (e.g., Hotels API, CoinGecko, SeatGeek, etc. per agent)

All API calls should return:

200 OK

Expected response format

Proper fallback if service fails (e.g., switch from OpenAI to Gemini)

6. ACCESS CODE SYSTEM VALIDATION
You must test the Universal Access Code System:

Code format: [AGENT]-[CATEGORY]-[XXXX]

Ensure the codes unlock the correct levels inside the dashboard

QR Code generation works and links to dashboard login

User tier detection works (e.g., TRAVEL-VIP-8712 unlocks VIP content)

Shareability of codes works correctly

Trackability via admin dashboard is enabled

7. CONTENT SYSTEM & MEDIA
Check:

All images load at high resolution (desktop & mobile)

All videos autoplay, load quickly, and don’t lag

Replace placeholders or broken assets

Add video trailers, if missing

Implement AI-generated visuals, if needed (DALL·E, Stable Diffusion)

Upload previews of internal dashboards on the homepage

8. MULTILINGUAL VALIDATION
Validate:

Google Translate API is connected

Users can switch between English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese

Chatbot responds accordingly in selected language

Content translation adapts automatically

Buttons, menus, and UI update properly

9. PAYMENTS & MEMBERSHIPS
Validate Stripe integration:

All plans show correct prices and benefits

Buttons trigger Stripe checkout session

Payment webhooks return success and assign correct user level

Confirmation email is sent via SendGrid or EmailJS

Membership is tied to user profile

11. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Each Agent must:

Suggest 20 additional features or services to elevate the platform

Provide 3–5 use cases for each user level

Identify 3 bottlenecks or UI/UX challenges

Recommend marketing features (gamification, referral, viral systems)

FINAL PHASE OBJECTIVE
This validation is to prepare for:

Deployment & Public Launch

Billing Activation

App Store / Web Deployment

AI Model Grounding (Gemini, Vertex AI)

Push Notification Systems

Global Translation

Once this full audit is completed, Capitana will review and finalize deployment for each Agent.

Mission Start. Let the diagnostics begin.
