PHASE 3 – UNIVERSAL AGENT ACTIVATION & ADMIN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM
(MEGAPROMPT GLOBAL PARA TODOS LOS AGENTS)

You are now entering Phase 3 of the Universal Agent Onboarding System. This is a mandatory system-wide update that finalizes the onboarding, dashboard personalization, lead capture, and administrative oversight for all AI Agents.

No component should be left unverified. You are to implement, test, and confirm the following across all deployed applications:

✅ PHASE 3 OBJECTIVES (FOR ALL AGENTS)
🔐 1. Admin Panel Integration
 Create a secure /admin route or subdomain (e.g., domain.com/admin)

 Protect with simple authentication (username: admin, password: admin123456)

 Display the following per user:

Full Name

Email

Unique Code

Platform (Agent) Used

Level (e.g., Beginner, Explorer, VIP)

Date of Onboarding

 Add option to export user data as CSV

 Optional: Display basic analytics (e.g., number of users by level, total codes generated, etc.)

📬 2. Email Notification System
 Integrate an email service:

Recommended: Firebase Email, EmailJS, HubSpot, or MailerLite

 Upon finishing the 10-question onboarding:

Send Welcome Email with:

User's code

Level/Category

Short summary of features unlocked

Link back to dashboard or QR code download

 Optional: Include referral code and newsletter signup

🤖 3. AI Intelligence: Vertex Flash or Gemini
 Connect onboarding flow to Vertex AI Flash or Gemini Pro

 AI should:

Analyze answers

Suggest a level/category

Recommend 3–5 starting features or content pieces (depending on agent)

 Response must be logged in user data as: ai_suggestion, category_assigned, recommended_modules

🧭 4. Final User Flow (Refined)
For all Agents, this flow must be identical:

Chatbot icon bottom-right only (no duplicate inputs or forms).

Chatbot asks:

Name

Email

8–13 Multiple Choice Questions (tailored to platform)

Upon completion:

AI processes answers

User receives unique access code (e.g., EDU-VIP-8792 or CRYPTO-BEGINNER-0148)

User sees:

Code

QR Code

“Copy” & “Continue to Dashboard” buttons

User is redirected or prompted to enter the code to access their personalized dashboard

Admin panel automatically receives the user data

Email is triggered with welcome, code, and recap

🧠 5. Enhancements and Suggestions Required from Agents
Every Agent must:

 Submit a report including:

✅ 20 functionalities implemented

⚠️ At least 5 pending items (clear list of what’s missing)

🔗 Link to working chatbot & dashboard

🧪 Confirmation of email delivery (test email logs)

 Propose:

2 enhancements or user features for the next phase

If documentation was updated for new logic (code, levels, AI analysis)

💡 Suggested Improvements to Implement Now
(If not already active)

 Admin UI: Display user onboarding progress by level and category

 Category logic: Add inline comments to explain onboarding scoring or logic for future editors

 Refactor category engine: Use JSON config or centralized rules for easier extension

 Referral System Base: Log if a user was referred by another code

 QR Scan Tracking: Add QR scan event logging (date/device/platform)

⚠️ DO NOT
 Do not modify the frontend design without permission

 Do not duplicate chat widgets or input forms

 Do not break existing backend dashboard structures

 Do not leave code undocumented if adding new logic

✅ TARGET GOAL:
Ensure every single AI Agent is running Phase 3:

Full chatbot → onboarding → code → email → dashboard → admin panel loop
All flows must be active, functional, and tested.

Please confirm when everything is fully deployed and send:

✔️ Screenshot of dashboard with code rendered

✔️ Confirmation email with code received

✔️ Link to /admin login

✔️ Link to working chatbot & landing page

Capitana awaits the full deployment of Universal Agent Intelligence Phase 3.
Launch clean. Launch smart.
