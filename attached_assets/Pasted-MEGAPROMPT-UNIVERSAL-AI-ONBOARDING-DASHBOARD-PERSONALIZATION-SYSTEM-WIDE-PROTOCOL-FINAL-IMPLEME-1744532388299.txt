MEGAPROMPT UNIVERSAL – AI ONBOARDING + DASHBOARD PERSONALIZATION
SYSTEM-WIDE PROTOCOL: FINAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE

Please verify and activate the following structure across all platforms:

1. FRONTEND AI CHAT ONBOARDING (Pre-Dashboard)
This is the first interaction users experience before logging into the platform. It should:

A. Begin with a welcome message:
“Hi there! Welcome to [Platform Name]. I’m your AI Assistant. Let’s personalize your experience.”

B. Ask 3 Core Fields for Lead Capture:
Name (text input)

Email (text input)

Optional: Referral Code or Invite Code (if applicable)

These fields will automatically create a new entry in the Admin Panel’s Lead List, labeled as:
[PlatformName]_Leads → Full Name, Email, Date, Referral, QuizScore, MembershipInterest

2. INTELLIGENT ONBOARDING QUIZ (10–15 Multiple Selections)
The chat must then automatically continue into a smart conversational flow with 10–15 dynamic questions using multiple option selection format. Each question must be contextualized to the platform (e.g., fitness, finance, education, crypto, etc.).

Examples:

For Fitness AI: “What are your fitness goals?”

For Sports AI: “Which leagues are you most interested in?”

For Edu AI: “What subjects are you struggling with?”

Technical Requirements:

Must support multi-selection where users can select more than one answer.

All responses must be stored and mapped to the user profile.

Once all answers are received, trigger a system message:

“Thanks! Your custom dashboard is now being prepared…”

3. POST-LOGIN DASHBOARD EXPERIENCE (Personalized Dashboard)
When the user logs in and enters the Dashboard (Home tab), they must be greeted by a personalized dashboard view based on the answers they gave during onboarding.

Dashboard Must Include:
Custom welcome message (e.g., “Welcome back, Alex! Here's your tailored experience.”)

A summary panel of their selected interests, goals, and features.

Pre-loaded content, modules, or shortcuts based on their answers (e.g., fitness plans, finance tools, educational lessons, crypto alerts, etc.)

Active display of their membership level and options to upgrade.

4. AI CHATBOT INSIDE DASHBOARD (Post-Onboarding Assistant)
This chat interface is not the same as the frontend AI onboarding. This assistant must:

Be connected to the Gemini / Vertex AI assistant.

Provide access to the full set of features (minimum 20) defined for the platform.

Support file upload (image, PDF), voice commands, language selection, and direct feature activation.

Reference user context from onboarding (e.g., suggest workouts, courses, stocks, etc.)

Example message:

“I see you're interested in CrossFit and meal planning. Want to begin your first session today?”

5. ADMIN PANEL – LEAD & USER TRACKING (Phase 2 prompt to follow)
For now, ensure:

All emails and names collected from the frontend onboarding chat are stored in the backend or Firebase DB.

Leads should be tagged with Quiz Completed, Membership Plan Interested, and Platform Source.

This lead list should be exportable and visible in the Admin Panel (to be defined in the next prompt).

6. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Each platform (e.g., Fitness AI, JetAI, CryptoBot, etc.) must confirm:

Feature	Status	Notes
Frontend Chat visible on landing	✅	Should auto-start
Name & Email input fields	✅	Stored in Leads DB
10–15 Smart Multiple-Selection Questions	✅	Dynamic per platform
Personalized Dashboard on Login	✅	Based on quiz responses
Dashboard AI Chat Assistant	✅	Gemini/Vertex-based
Responses stored to Firebase/DB	✅	Indexed by UID/email
Admin Panel shows leads	⚠️	Awaiting Phase 2 prompt
Membership plan selection linked	✅	To Stripe/Paywall or placeholder
7. SUGGESTIONS FOR ENHANCEMENT (Optional)
Add progress bar or visual steps indicator during onboarding (e.g., 30%, 60%, Complete).

Auto-email a “Welcome + Summary of Your Answers” PDF after onboarding.

Trigger real-time generation of a personalized plan (PDF/HTML component) after the 15th question.

Add smart analytics to show drop-off rate and optimize flow.

REMINDER TO ALL TEAMS & AGENTS
The initial chat onboarding system must remain separate from the dashboard chat. It serves two functions:

Lead capture & personalization.

First-level intelligence for custom dashboard generation.

DO NOT overwrite or sync the frontend chatbot with the dashboard assistant directly unless the routing is intelligent.

Please verify that this structure is correctly implemented and respond with:

✅ Features confirmed

❌ Features missing
