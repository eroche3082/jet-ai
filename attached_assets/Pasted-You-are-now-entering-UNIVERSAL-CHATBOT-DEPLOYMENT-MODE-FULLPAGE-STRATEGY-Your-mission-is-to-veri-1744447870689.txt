You are now entering UNIVERSAL CHATBOT DEPLOYMENT MODE – FULLPAGE STRATEGY.

Your mission is to verify and deploy the **AI Chatbot** system globally across this Agent with **FullPage capabilities, persistent availability, and modular intelligence**. This is not a basic widget. This is the AI core of the platform.

### ✅ GLOBAL VISIBILITY & POSITIONING

1. The chatbot must be:
   - **Available on all pages and routes** of the application
   - Represented by a **floating icon button (bottom-right or left)**
   - When clicked, it must **expand to FullPage mode**
   - Return to floating mode on command or minimize

2. This behavior must persist regardless of:
   - Layout changes
   - Route transitions
   - Tab or section context

---

### ✅ FULLPAGE EXPERIENCE & CAPABILITIES

When expanded, the chatbot must open in **FULLSCREEN MODE** with the following:

- **A left Side Panel / Menu** with:
  - Profile or Avatar section
  - Navigation to chatbot-specific tools or views
  - Button shortcuts (e.g. “Create QR”, “Open AR”, “Upload File”, “History”)

- **Main conversation area** (full width/height):
  - Multimodal interface (text, voice, image)
  - Display of responses with smart formatting (code blocks, images, charts, buttons)
  - Context-aware memory for personalized suggestions

- **Action Toolbar (icons)** with:
  - Microphone (STT)
  - Speaker (TTS)
  - Image Upload
  - QR Generator
  - QR Scanner
  - AR Viewer
  - VR Viewer
  - Copy / Share
  - Multilingual Toggle
  - Fullscreen / Minimize

### ✅ FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATIONS REQUIRED

- **Fallback AI Models:** OpenAI, Anthropic Claude
- **Audio:**
  - Speech-to-Text: Google STT / Whisper
  - Text-to-Speech: Google TTS / ElevenLabs

- **Storage & Logs:** Firebase (Firestore or Realtime DB)
- **Session Context:** Firebase Auth or Memory Engine

---

### ✅ UI/UX BEHAVIOR

- Chat must feel like a **dedicated experience**, not a mini-widget
- On mobile: full screen modal with bottom-safe UI
- On desktop: split layout with collapsible side menu
- The floating icon must never be obstructive and always accessible

---

### ✅ LANGUAGE & RESPONSE MODE

- Default language: English
- Recognize and respond in: Spanish, French, Portuguese
- Respect session language or allow toggle
- Use accurate voice playback if voice mode is enabled

---

### ✅ MANDATORY TEST CASES

Run the following actions as part of the verification:

- Open chatbot from homepage → expands to FullPage
- Switch tab → chatbot remains accessible
- Send voice input → chatbot transcribes and responds
- Upload image → chatbot responds with analysis
- Say: “Create QR for my profile” → chatbot generates QR
- Say: “Activate AR mode” → AR viewer launches
- Translate “Hola, ¿cómo estás?” → returns English translation
- Minimize → returns to floating icon with chat memory preserved

---
