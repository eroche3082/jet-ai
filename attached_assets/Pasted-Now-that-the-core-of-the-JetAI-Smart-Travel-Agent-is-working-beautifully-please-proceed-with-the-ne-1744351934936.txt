Now that the core of the JetAI Smart Travel Agent is working beautifully, please proceed with the next development phase focused on expansion, stability, and smart automation.

Here’s what I’d like you to focus on now:

1. **Stabilize & Expand Chatbot Capabilities**
   - Fix any current request errors (like “I'm having trouble processing your request”).
   - Add fallbacks if Gemini API temporarily fails (e.g., display a message or retry).
   - Include smarter flow logic so that the chatbot asks follow-up questions based on user input.
   - Include emoji support and markdown-style formatting for better interaction.

2. **Enhance AI Personalization**
   - Add a short onboarding flow where the user selects their travel preferences (budget, adventure, relaxation, luxury, etc.).
   - Save these preferences in local storage or Firebase if available.
   - Use the preferences to generate more tailored suggestions and itineraries.

3. **Expand Backend with APIs**
   - Integrate or simulate external travel APIs like:
     - Skyscanner (flights)
     - Booking.com (hotels)
     - Yelp or TripAdvisor (local activities/restaurants)
   - Add placeholder responses or mock JSON for now if real API keys are not present.

4. **Newsletter & Contact Section**
   - Make the newsletter subscription functional (connect to Mailchimp or save to Firebase).
   - Add tooltips or labels to the contact icons in the footer.
   - Display confirmation when a user subscribes.

5. **Experience Cards & Filters**
   - Add tag-based filtering for experiences (adventure, family, solo, luxury, etc.).
   - Enable dynamic loading of experiences from JSON or API in the backend.
   - Include ratings and icons (like difficulty level, price, duration).

6. **Stripe Checkout Integration**
   - Make sure the Stripe system works end-to-end: select experience → confirm → pay → confirmation screen.
   - Add a basic order summary modal before payment.

7. **Progress & Debug Panel**
   - Add a debug toggle (admin-only) to log chatbot activity and API requests.
   - Enable basic analytics: how many chats, what destinations are popular, etc.

Make sure everything is modular, clean, and ready for future export. Let me know once this phase is implemented so we can move to the Premium AI Automation Layer and Membership System.

Thanks!
