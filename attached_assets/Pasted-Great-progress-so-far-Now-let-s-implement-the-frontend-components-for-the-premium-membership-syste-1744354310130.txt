Great progress so far. Now, let’s implement the frontend components for the premium membership system and itinerary engine using the new API routes.

Here are the tasks for Phase 4:

---

### 1. 💼 Membership Dashboard UI
- Create a **"My Membership"** page (or dashboard section) that shows:
  - Current membership tier (Basic / Freemium / Premium)
  - Number of remaining AI credits and searches
  - Upgrade options with pricing and benefits comparison
  - “Buy More Credits” button (connect to Stripe if enabled)
- Display user tier visually (e.g., color-coded badge)

---

### 2. ✈️ Itinerary Manager UI
- Create a new page called **"My Itineraries"**:
  - Show a list of saved itineraries (title, date, destination)
  - Allow clicking each to view, update, or delete
  - If itinerary is public, provide a shareable link
- Add a button to create a new itinerary from scratch
- Enable bookmarking functionality for favorites

---

### 3. 💬 Chat UI Enhancements (AI Credit Aware)
- Display remaining credits inside the chat interface (e.g., “You have 3 AI responses left this month”).
- If the user runs out of credits:
  - Display an upsell prompt inside the chat (“Upgrade to Premium for unlimited responses”).
  - Prevent further messages until upgraded or credits purchased.
- If user is Premium, display “Unlimited” in a green badge inside the chat header.

---

### 4. 🔐 User Profile & Authentication
- Show a logged-in user dropdown with:
  - Account settings
  - “My Membership”
  - “My Itineraries”
  - Log out
- If not logged in, prompt user to sign up or sign in to access AI features.

---

### 5. 🧪 Smart Testing Mode
- Add an admin toggle (or query param like `?dev=true`) that:
  - Shows backend debug info (credits, API logs, usage stats)
  - Lets the dev simulate different user tiers for testing

---

### 6. 📦 Visual Polish & Component Refactoring
- Organize all new features into reusable components:
  - `<MembershipCard />`
  - `<ItineraryCard />`
  - `<CreditTracker />`
  - `<UpgradeModal />`
- Use Tailwind, if enabled, to keep style consistent with the current layout
- Add light animations/transitions to enhance interactivity

---

Once all of this is implemented, we’ll move to **Phase 5**, which includes:

- 📍 Location-aware AI suggestions (based on IP or location input)
- 🌐 JetAI Franchising Mode (subdomains, white label support)
- 💸 Affiliate engine for travel influencers and creators
- 📱 Mobile PWA version for on-the-go travel planning

Let me know once Phase 4 is ready and tested!
