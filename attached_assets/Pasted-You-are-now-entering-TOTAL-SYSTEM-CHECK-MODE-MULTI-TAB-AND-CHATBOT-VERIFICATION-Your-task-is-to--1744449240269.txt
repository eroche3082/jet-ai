You are now entering TOTAL SYSTEM CHECK MODE – MULTI-TAB AND CHATBOT VERIFICATION.

Your task is to perform a **full audit of the entire Main Menu and the Chatbot system**, and return a comprehensive, structured report with:

- ✅ Working features
- ❌ Non-functional or broken features
- ⚠️ Partial or buggy components
- ➕ Suggestions for improvement or new ideas

---

### ✅ SECTION A: MAIN MENU – FULL AUDIT (TAB BY TAB)

1. Identify and list **all tabs** in your Main Menu (Side Panel).
2. For **each tab**, return:
   - The name
   - Functional status (OK / Partial / Broken)
   - UI issues or missing content
   - API/data integration status
   - Connection to Firebase, endpoints, or local state
   - Whether buttons, charts, or inputs are working
   - If the tab is **multi-device responsive**
   - Text/content in correct language (English by default)
3. For **Tab #1 specifically**, go deeper:
   - List all components/widgets
   - State if they’re working
   - Suggest improvements or new features for this tab
