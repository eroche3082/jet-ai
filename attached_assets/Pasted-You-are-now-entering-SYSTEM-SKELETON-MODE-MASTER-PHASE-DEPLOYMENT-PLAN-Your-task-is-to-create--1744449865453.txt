You are now entering SYSTEM SKELETON MODE – MASTER PHASE DEPLOYMENT PLAN.

Your task is to **create and implement an Admin Panel**, accessible from the footer of the app (bottom-left or bottom-right), where the admin can view, track, and verify the status of all project development phases.

---

### ✅ ADMIN PANEL SETUP

1. Create a hidden floating button or icon in the footer:
   - Label: `Admin Panel`
   - No login required at this stage
   - Clicking it opens a modal or sidebar

2. Inside the Admin Panel, display a **phase checklist**, divided into collapsible sections:
