You are now entering PHASE 3.2 – VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS & DYNAMIC DATA INTEGRATION.

Your task is to enhance each **verified tab** in the Main Menu with dynamic functionality, visual responsiveness, and context-aware components. For **each tab marked as ✅ or ⚠️ in Prompt 3.1**, perform the following:

---

### ✅ Checklist Per Tab

1. Add **loading states** or skeleton screens while fetching data.
2. Validate that all UI elements are **responsive** across screen sizes.
3. Integrate **real-time or simulated data** for visual components (charts, tables, widgets).
4. Ensure buttons or actions trigger **correct backend/API** calls (or mock if needed).
5. Connect each tab with the **chatbot context memory**, so it knows:
   - What the tab is about
   - What insights it can provide
   - What actions the user can take
6. Add **animations or transitions** for better experience (entry, hover, loading).
7. Display **empty state visuals** (e.g., “No transactions yet” or “No bookings”).
8. Add **semantic structure** for accessibility (aria-labels, roles).
