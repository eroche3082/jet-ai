You are now entering AUDIT & ACTIVATION MODE.

Your task as an Agent is to verify, activate, and report on every component of your assigned application. Perform a **deep audit** of the entire system.

**1. API KEY VERIFICATION (CURRENT STATUS)**

→ List all API Keys currently integrated and in use, including:
- Gemini API
- Google API Keys (Group 1, 2, 3)
- Stripe API
- Firebase API
- Plaid / Yodlee / MX (for finance)
- ElevenLabs (if used)
- Whisper / OpenAI / Anthropic Claude
- RapidAPI (if used)
- YouTube / Discord / Canva / HubSpot / Zapier / other 3rd party APIs

→ For each key:
- Confirm its presence
- Confirm that it is being called correctly
- Confirm it is returning responses without errors

**2. MISSING API KEYS OR SERVICES**

→ List all API Keys or services that are:
- Referenced but not implemented
- Needed but not yet configured
- Partially connected or throwing errors

**3. RECOMMENDED FUTURE INTEGRATIONS (20 SUGGESTIONS)**

→ Suggest up to 20 AI-powered or external services that would enhance the current app. These could include:
- Google Calendar Sync
- Real-time Weather API
- AI Scheduling Assistant
- Multi-user Collaboration Layer
- Voice Authentication
- QR Code Generator
- SMS Alerts (Twilio)
- Web3 Wallet
- Rewards Engine
- User Heatmap Analytics
- NLP Sentiment Analyzer
- Real-time Notifications
- Version Control Sync (GitHub/GitLab)
- Payment Splitting API
- Crypto Conversion & Tracker
- Language Switching Engine
- AI-Powered Text Summarizer
- Custom Avatar Personalization Engine
- Document AI for contracts/receipts
- AI-based Pricing Optimization

**4. INTERFACE & COMPONENT CHECK**

→ Check the **Main Menu** and verify:
- Every tab is active and visible
- Every tab has functional and relevant content
- No broken links, null views, or 404s

→ Check that:
- All buttons are clickable and trigger their assigned actions
- All modals and transitions work properly
- All tabs match the current language and context

**5. CHATBOT DIAGNOSTIC**

→ The chatbot must:
- Be active and fully connected to Gemini or OpenAI
- Support full-screen view
- Handle text, voice, and (optionally) image prompts
- Be responsive across devices
- Clearly indicate when it is processing and replying
- Respond based on the Agent’s tone and role
- Support multi-language (or provide fallback)
- Show its current version and status

**6. LANGUAGE UNIFICATION**

→ Confirm the entire app is in one default language (English by default).
→ Identify and list any parts of the app still in another language or with inconsistent labels.
→ Ensure multi-language toggle or translation support is active (if applicable).

**7. ENDPOINTS & CONNECTIONS**

→ Test every internal and external endpoint:
- Server API routes
- Firebase Functions
- Gemini/Vertex integrations
- DB connections (PostgreSQL/Firebase)
- Webhook triggers
- Third-party callbacks

→ All must return valid responses (200 OK or equivalent).

**8. STATUS & PHASE REPORT**

→ Indicate:
- What phase of development the Agent is currently in
- What is fully complete
- What needs revision or completion
- What can be optimized or replaced

**9. FINAL SYSTEM CHECK**

→ Once the above audit is complete:
- Confirm all modules are connected
- Confirm authentication is working
- Confirm all pages and routes are functioning
- Confirm frontend and backend are in sync
- Trigger a final system health check
- Report SUCCESS or list failures with location and log

**IMPORTANT:** All results should be returned in clear format:
- ✅ = OK
- ❌ = Error / Missing
- ⚠️ = Partial or Needs Review

Activate report in: `console.log`, `UI debug window`, or via endpoint `/agent-status`

Language: **English only**  
All modules must be fully operational or reported as broken/missing.

You are now in FULL SYSTEM SYNC & AUDIT MODE. Begin.
